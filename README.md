# Xenon_Reborn

The main goal of this project is to offer a basic framework to implement an old school shoot-them-up game. 
Rookies can practice algorithm and basic Java programming to acquire developement skills.

This framework is based on LibGDX and runs only on a desktop computer (Java SE 8) until now.

The first projet "RBN_Xenon_Reborn" is a classic Eclipse Project generated by the LibGdx config tool.
The second projet "xenon-reborn-mvn" is a conversion into a maven project.

Both sources codes point to the same directory thanx to "ln -s SOURCE TARGET".
